# Project_5_Review_Scrapper

This project is a web scraper that extracts product reviews from Flipkart.com and stores them in a MongoDB database. The web scraper is built using the Flask web framework in Python and uses the Beautiful Soup library to parse the HTML of the website.

The user can enter a search query for a product, and the scraper will extract the reviews for the top search result. The reviews are stored in a CSV file and also inserted into a MongoDB database hosted on MongoDB Atlas.

The project also includes logging functionality that logs any errors encountered during the scraping process. The logging information is stored in a log file for further analysis.

Overall, this project demonstrates how web scraping can be used to extract valuable information from websites and how the data can be stored in a database for further analysis.
